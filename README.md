## Application Description
Popularify is a Spotify Popularity checker. Spotify keeps track of the popularity of various different objects (albums, artists, and tracks). The app runs a search based on the entered search type and search term, and returns the top 3 results. A user can click any one of the search results to add it to their List. They can then add a note to any list item by clicking the edit (pencil) button. They can also choose to delete a single item by clicking the trash button, or clear their entire list by clicking the "Clear" button. Once finished creating their list, the user can click the “Export” button, which will export the list to a CSV file.
